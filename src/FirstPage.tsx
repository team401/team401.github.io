                      FIRST stands for For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology 
                      and was founded by Dean Kamen in 1982. The FIRST vision is "to transform our 
                      culture by creating a world where science and technology are celebrated and 
                      where young people dream of becoming science and technology leaders." Today, 
                      thousands of competitions are held all over the world for children of all age 
                      groups and backgrounds.
